//! Logical block lifecycle management for KVBM.
//!
//! This crate provides the core block lifecycle system:
//! - Type-safe state transitions (Reset -> Complete -> Registered)
//! - Block registry with deduplication and attachments
//! - Active/inactive/reset pool management
//! - Event pipeline for distributed coordination
//! - Block manager orchestration
