"""End-to-end tests for multimodal KV routing with vLLM.

Architecture:
  Frontend -> MM Router Worker -> vLLM Worker
                (computes mm_hash)   (publishes KV events)

This test validates MM-aware routing by sending repeated multimodal requests and
asserting that router overlap is greater than 1 block (regression guard against
text-only/partially-matched hash paths that typically show 1/N overlap).
